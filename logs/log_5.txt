SSH-Audit on Port 22
The SSH-Audit of the SSH service on port 22 revealed several vulnerabilities and advisories:

CVEs Identified:
CVE-2021-41617: Privilege escalation via supplemental groups (CVSSv2: 7.0).
CVE-2020-15778: Command injection via anomalous argument transfers (CVSSv2: 7.8).
CVE-2016-20012: Enumerate usernames via challenge response (CVSSv2: 5.3).
Concerns with Key Exchange Algorithms:
Usage of elliptic curves suspected to be backdoored by the U.S. National Security Agency.
Concern with Host-Key Algorithms:
The usage of the SHA-1 hash algorithm, deemed broken, and usage of backdoored elliptic curves.
Encryption Algorithm Concerns:
Vulnerability to the Terrapin attack for the chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com cipher allowing message prefix truncation.
Recommendations:
Removal of several key exchange algorithms, key algorithms, encryption algorithms, and MAC algorithms suspected of vulnerabilities or are deprecated.
Nikto on the HTTP Service (Port 80)
Nikto scan of the HTTP service identified:

Missing security headers which could lead to clickjacking (X-Frame-Options) and MIME type confusion attacks (X-Content-Type-Options).
The server version nginx/1.18.0 is outdated compared to the current versions of nginx.
Gobuster Directory Enumeration (Port 80)
The Gobuster attempt to enumerate directories on the HTTP service encountered an issue. An error occurred because the server returns a status code that matches the provided options for non-existing URLs, which indicates a need to adjust the Gobuster parameters or handle special server configurations.

Insights & Recommendations:
SSH Vulnerabilities: The identified vulnerabilities in the SSH service highlight the need for updating OpenSSH packages, hardening SSH configurations (removing weak or compromised algorithms), and conducting further in-depth vulnerability assessments.
HTTP Service Vulnerabilities: For the HTTP service, updating to the latest version of nginx and configuring necessary security headers are immediate steps to improve security posture.
Gobuster Enumeration: For successful directory enumeration with Gobuster, it may be necessary to tune the parameters or explore alternative methods to bypass or handle redirects and other server configurations that prevent standard directory enumeration techniques.

Penetration Testing Progress Report on Hack The Box Machine (IP 10.10.11.242)
Summary: In the initial phases of the penetration test on the specified Hack The Box Machine, we targeted and analyzed SSH and HTTP services to discover vulnerabilities that could be further explored for exploitation.

Findings:
SSH Service Analysis (Port 22):
SSH-Audit identified critical vulnerabilities and advisories:
CVE-2021-41617 (Privilege escalation)
CVE-2020-15778 (Command injection)
CVE-2016-20012 (Username enumeration via challenge response)
Key Exchange Algorithms, Host-Key Algorithms, and Encryption Algorithm Concerns were also noted, pointing towards the potential usage of compromised or broken cryptographic measures.
HTTP Service Review (Port 80):
Nikto indicated missing security headers and an outdated nginx server version (nginx/1.18.0), which could expose the server to various web vulnerabilities.
The attempt to enumerate directories using Gobuster faced challenges due to server configurations that interfered with standard enumeration techniques.
Next Steps & Recommendations:
SSH Service Exploitation:
Update OpenSSH packages to address CVE vulnerabilities.
Harden SSH configurations by removing weak or potentially compromised cryptographic algorithms.
HTTP Service Security Enhancement:
Update nginx to the latest version and embed necessary security headers to mitigate risks like clickjacking and MIME type confusion attacks.
Directory Enumeration:
Adjust Gobuster parameters or explore alternative enumeration methods to bypass server configurations preventing standard directory discovery.
Action Plan Review:
Given the vulnerabilities identified during the initial security assessments, concrete exploitation attempts require a strategic approach. The action plan should now include vulnerability exploitation strategies focused on the SSH service, considering the identified CVEs, and addressing the security configurations on the HTTP service.

Next Immediate Steps:

Explore and exploit SSH vulnerabilities, prioritizing those with high CVSS scores.
Update and secure the HTTP service as a preventive measure against potential web-based attacks.
I recommend a review of the current findings and strategize the penetration testing efforts to leverage the vulnerabilities discovered for successful exploitation. The strategy would potentially evolve with each successful step or challenge encountered, aiming for a comprehensive assessment and ultimately, the exploitation of the target server.

Please advise on the prioritization of the next steps for continuous progression in the penetration testing process.

It's crucial to note that the absence of direct exploits in the SearchSploit database doesn't rule out the possibility of vulnerabilities being exploitable. It might be worthwhile to conduct further research on each vulnerability, including checking other security databases, forums, and publications for any known exploits or proof-of-concept (PoC) code.

Additionally, considering other penetration testing strategies and potentially manually crafting an exploit based on the detailed information available for each vulnerability might be necessary based on the target's configuration and the environment.

Updated Penetration Testing Strategy - Hack The Box Machine (IP 10.10.11.242)
Following the latest findings through the use of the SearchSploit tool, we've encountered a significant development in our penetration testing process. Despite a thorough search for direct exploits related to the identified vulnerabilities and the nginx version, no ready-made exploits were found in the Exploit Database for the following items:

CVE-2021-41617
CVE-2020-15778
CVE-2016-20012
nginx 1.18.0
Implication of Findings:
The lack of direct exploits for these vulnerabilities and software versions suggests a couple of strategic moves:

Extended Research: There's a necessity for broader research across different security databases, forums, and hacker publications. While SearchSploit is comprehensive, it might not capture very recent exploits or those shared in less formal channels.
Exploit Development: For seasoned penetration testers, the detailed information available for each vulnerability might offer enough to speculate on potential exploit mechanisms. Crafting a custom exploit, though time-intensive, could be a viable path.
Alternative Attack Vectors: Considering the limitation in direct exploits, revisiting the penetration testing plan to exploit other potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations on the server might be beneficial. This could include password brute-forcing, misconfigurations, or leveraging other services exposed by the server.
Next Steps Recommendations:
Given the current scenario, the following steps are recommended:

Conduct a Broader Vulnerability Search: Utilize cybersecurity platforms like CVE Details, the National Vulnerability Database, and other reputable forums to gather more intelligence on potential exploits or vulnerability discussions.
Consider Manual Exploit Crafting: If expertise allows, consider developing an exploit based on the available vulnerability details. This might include scripting an attack to exploit the SSH command injection vulnerability or deriving a method to escalate privileges based on the CVE-2021-41617 advisory.
Re-evaluate the Server Attack Surface: With no immediate exploitable vulnerabilities, it might be worth reassessing the server's exposed services for other less obvious yet exploitable issues. This might involve a deeper dive into the configurations, enumeration of additional services, or even social engineering techniques.
Final Thoughts:
Penetration testing, especially against well-guarded targets, often requires adapting strategies based on available information and barriers encountered. While direct exploits provide a straightforward path to exploitation, their absence is not a dead end but a prompt for a more creative and in-depth approach to uncovering and exploiting vulnerabilities.

Advisory Note: Moving forward, we may need to adjust objectives and potentially seek further specifics or clarifications to ensure a comprehensive and successful penetration test.
